# Dancing-Circles
Hello my name is Selim Emir Erol. I am a second year Electricals and Electronics Engineering student at METU and this is my "Dancing Circles" project in order to be a member of METU RAS society.
In this project, when users press "SPACE" button, a circle with random radius, distance, color and angular speed is added to the system. These circles creates a chaotic scene in the screen. If users press "ENTER" button, last circle is removed from the system.
